############################
Welcome to my documentation!
############################

I've collected these information and it is my personal experience. I know,
there are alternate ways to do it, but this is how I chose to document it ---
or because it was the only way how it worked for me at that time.
The more I grow older, the more I need to document mainly for myself. :)

.. important:: This documentation is not specific to one version of one
               application --- as it is usually the case. So it will be more a
               rolling update. At least in the beginning. Once I've created a
               proper state, versions will be of interest, to keep track of the
               changes.
