Testing on vulnerabilities
**************************

Security flaws are discovered in standard software regularly. **Mostly, they
affect everyone.** At least, you should be certain, if you're affected or not.
Sometimes, the vendors provide good information on those discovered
vulnerabilities. But sometimes you need test for your own good night's sleep.

Here are some links with information/software you can use to test your own
network vulnerability.

.. note:: As you see, the list is quite short at the moment. Because I've just
          started to document it myself.

.. caution:: I don't claim, this list is complete or will ever be.
